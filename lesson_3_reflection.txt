When would you want to creat a remote repository reather than keeping all your work local?

	When I want to work with other persons. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I thing that the majority of software projects need more atention about the commits, if I pull the changes manually, the commits will be logical.
